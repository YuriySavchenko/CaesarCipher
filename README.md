# Caesar Cipher

```
Simple implementation of Caesar Cipher which allows encrypt available text.
Also we can decrypt encrypted text. 

For encrypting text we must call function with two parameters:
1. Some text string.
2. Key - this key need in future for decryption.

Function for decrypting is similar to previous. For decryption encrypted text we can invoke
another procedure (also) with two parameters:
1. Encrypted text.
2. Key which was using during encryption.

```
